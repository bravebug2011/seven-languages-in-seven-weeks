Exercises from *Seven Languages in Seven Weeks*
===============================================

When I resume working on this project the project home page will be updated to
reflect my progress.

As I work through the exercises in the book [*Seven Languages in Seven
Weeks*](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) by
Bruce Tate, I will keep this repository updated with my solutions,
foolish-looking exploratory code and all! If you're working through this as well
and have any feedback (or want any feedback) I'm open to it. :)
