# Find:
#
# 1. Prolog has some input/output features as well. Find print predicates that
# print out variables.
#
# 2. Find a way to use the print predicates to print only successful solutions.
# How do they work? 

# Do:
#
# 1. Modify the Sudoku solver to work on six-by-six puzzles (squares are 3x2)
# and 9x9 puzzles)
#
# 2. Make the Sudoku solver print prettier solutions.
#
# 3. Solve the Eight Queens problem by taking a list of queens. Rather than a
# tuple, represent each queen with an integer, from 1-8. Get the row of a queen
# by its position in the list and the column by the value in the list.
